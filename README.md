# VersaBuilt GCode Files

This is a monorepo that holds all of VersaBuilt's GCode in one place. This includes
dispatchers for Nitro, Oxygen, and Robot2CNC. It does not include specific GCode for
machining parts. Only GCode that assists VersaBuilt Drivers.


Note: As of June 2020, Oxygen and Nitro share all of their GCode files. They will all be under
the nitro folder.
